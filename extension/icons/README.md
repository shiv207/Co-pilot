# Extension Icons

## Required Icons
The Chrome extension requires the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16px)
- icon48.png (48x48px)
- icon128.png (128x128px)

## How to Generate Icons
1. Open the `convert_icons.html` file in a web browser
2. Click each "Convert" button to generate the PNG files
3. Right-click on each generated image and select "Save Image As..."
4. Save each file with the correct name (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) in this folder

## Icon Design
The icons use a sparkle symbol in the purple theme color (#7c3aed) that matches the UI design of the application. This design is consistent with the sparkle symbols used in the main application UI.

## Alternative Method
If the HTML converter doesn't work, you can use any image editing software to create these icons with a sparkle symbol in the purple theme color (#7c3aed).
