These icon files need to be created manually:
- icon16.png (16x16px)
- icon48.png (48x48px)
- icon128.png (128x128px)

You can generate these icons with the sparkle symbol similar to the one used in the UI. 
For now, the extension will work without these icons, but they should be added for a complete package.
